## About
While Apping seems a very weird verb, it is a slang reference to the process of applications to graduate programs. While current  graduate students have had the opportunity to get advice from their seniors on the nitty gritties of this process and so do the current applicants, this information is often incomplete and requires a lot of effort (and often long waiting times for replies). In particular, since many online resources help towards the general application process, the advice sought is often university and/or program specific. So a bunch of us thought we would pool in our perspectives to create a resource where it is easy to find program specific information. It is an FAQ of sorts based on whatever each of us has been personally asked so far.


## Contributing
This website is simply a [github repo](https://github.com/AppingResource/AppingResource.github.io) and contributing is as simple as submitting a pull request. This repo is set up as an organization and hence people can be added to it. If you want to be added, let any of the current organization members know and they'll give you access.

In order to contribute, navigate to `_posts` directory and add a file (right in the git repo in the browser). In fact the easiest way is to copy an existing blog post. Note that the filename needs to be in the format as other posts.  The file itself can be edited in the github repo. At the top there are a few meta tags. Change the title, date, author and (author) email and (author) website. In the rest of the post, you can write in kramdown (superset of markdown) which has almost all the simple text formatting features. Here's a [quick reference for kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html). Once you save the file, if the markup is correct, it'll be automatically compiled and rendered as a blog post. Any updates to the post in the future will be similarly applied.

Finally, don't forget to put your name in `contributors.md` in the root directory. 

## Guidelines
The objective of this blog is to help applicants get a students' perspective on what is the ground reality in a particular program. Think of it as a compilation of all the questions that applicants have personally asked you (or the questions you would have liked to known in advance). A summary of essential information regarding tuition, living expenses etc. along with pointers to online resources is also appreciated.
