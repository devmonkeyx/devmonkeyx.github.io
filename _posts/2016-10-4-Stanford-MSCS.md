# Academics
Stanford offers a 2 year Masters program in Computer Science. 
The MS program is primarily composed of courses. According to the [course requirements](http://cs.stanford.edu/degrees/mscs/classes/planning/) you would need to do 45 units of credits, which is roughly 12-15 courses typically 2 years (5-6 quarters).

Stanford website says, this is a terminal degree. What it means is that it is NOT supposed to lead to a PhD by default. What it is supposed to do is equip you better for jobs. Having said that there are ample research opportunities to build up your profile before reapplying for a PhD program. 

# Costs

## Tuition

You can choose to do 8-10 units and pay around $10k per quarter as tuition or 11-18 units and pay ~15k (latest [tuition expenses](http://exploredegrees.stanford.edu/tuitionfeesandhousing/#tuitiontext)).

## Assistantships
There are ample opportunities for TAships (Teaching Assistantship) and RAships (Research Assistantship), especially in and around CS department. 

A 50% TA/RA covers tuition, pays a good stipend and covers half of university insurance cost. It says 50% because you are expected to work 20 hours a week which is 50% of 40 hours in a 5 day week with 8 hours per day. A 25% TA/RA (uncommon) has half the benefits. More information and current stipend can be found [here](http://gfs.stanford.edu/salary17/)

One caveat to remember is that typically if you are a TA  or an RA ( you aren't allowed to do more than 10 units per quarter. 

### TA
Your chances of getting a TA are dependent on previously done courses and past teaching experience. Typically students who have done a course previously at Stanford are preferred over others. Typically students take a course in their first quarter and can TA that course in the next offering. Some courses are offered in all quarters and can support a new student from their second quarter. A typical TAship is 50%, requires a decent amount of time commitment and involves grading assignments, holding office hours, answering questions on Piazza (and sometimes attended the classes as well)

### RA
There are ample opportunities in and around CS department for RAships. Some require actual research to be conducted (call them Research RAships) while in others you would be required to code (like a software engineer) but in a research setting (call them Coding RAships). 

There are a lot of Coding RAships in CS and other departments (like Medicine, Management Science and Engineering, Business School etc). Such RAships typically involve developing a website, or a portal or implementing some algorithm. These are usually publicised in the department building, on internal mailing lists or on professors' webpages. 

For a Research RAship, you would typically need some experience in the form of research, class projects or classes in the particluar field. Sometimes they are put up on professors' webpages. A common way of finding openings is to talk to people (especially students of a professor of interest) to see if there is any opening.

The workload is dependent on the kind of work that is required of you, but typically has more flexible hours than a TAship.
